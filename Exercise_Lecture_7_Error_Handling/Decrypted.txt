File encryption is the science of writing the contents of a file in a secret code. Your encryption program should work like a filter, 
reading the contents of one file, modifying the data into a code, and then writing the coded contents out to a second file. The second file will 
be a version of the first file, but written in a secret code. 
Although there are complex encryption techniques, you should come up with a simple one of your own. For example, you could read the first file one 
character at a time, and add 10 to the character code of each character before it is written to the second file.
