 * Write a class named MonthDays. The class’s constructor should accept two arguments: 
 * •	An integer for month (1=January, 2 February, etc. )
 * •	An integer for the year
 * The class should have a method named getNumberOfDays that returns the number of days 
 * in the specified month. The method should use the following criteria to identify leap years: 
 * •	Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and 
 *      if only it is divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 will not be. 
 * •	If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and if only it is divisible
 *      by 4. For example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not. 
 * Demonstrate the class in a program that asks the user to enter the month (letting the user enter an integer in the range of 1 through 12) and the year. The program should display the number of days in that month. Here is a sample run of the program: 
 * Enter a month (1-12): 2 [Enter] 
 * Enter a year: 2008 [Enter] 
 * 29 days
