/**

 * Write a class for an insurance company to determine policy premiums. The class should have 
 * the variables customer id, type of policy(health/auto). Write the necessary constructors, 
 * accessor and mutator methods. The method/s should calculate the premium for health and auto 
 * insurance policy.  The premium is calculated as follows:
 * The health insurance method asks users whether they smoke; the premium is $250 for smokers and 
 * $190 for nonsmokers. The auto insurance method asks users to enter the number of traffic tickets 
 * they have received in the last three years. The premium is $175 for drivers with three or more 
 * tickets, $140 for those with one or two tickets, and $95 for those with no tickets
 * Write the demo class that asks the user for the customer id.  It also prompts each user for the 
 * type of policy neededâ€”health or auto. Calculate and display the premium for both the types of 
 * policies. Do you need static variables or methods here? Can you apply overloading?
