 * i.	Loanâ€”A public abstract class that implements the LoanConstants interface. A Loan includes a loan number,
 * customer last name, amount of loan, interest rate, and term. The constructor requires data for each of the fields
 * except interest rate. Do not allow loan amounts over $100,000. Force any loan term that is not one of the three defined
 * in the LoanConstants class to a short-term, one-year loan. Create a toString() method that displays all the loan data.
