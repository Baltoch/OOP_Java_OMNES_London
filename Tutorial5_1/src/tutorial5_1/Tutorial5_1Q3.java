 * Picky Publishing House publishes stories in three categories and has strict requirements for page counts in 
 * each category. Create an abstract class named Story that includes a story title, an author name, a number 
 * of pages, and a String message. Include get and set methods for each field. The method that sets the number 
 * of pages is abstract. Also include constants for the page limits in each category. Create three Story subclasses 
 * named Novel, Novella, and ShortStory, each with a unique setPages() method. A Novel must have more than
 * 100 pages, a Novella must have between 50 and 100 pages inclusive, and a ShortStory must have fewer than
 * 50 pages. If the parameter passed to any of the set methods in the child class is out of range, set the page value
 * but also create and store a message that indicates how many pages must be added or cut to satisfy the rules for
 * the story type. Write an application named Tutorial5_1Q3 that creates an array of at least six objects to demonstrate 
 * how the methods work for objects created both with valid and invalid page counts for each story type. For each 
 * story, display the title, author, page count, and message if any was generated. Save the files as Story.java, 
 * Novel.java, Novella.java, ShortStory.java, and Tutorial5_1Q3.java.
