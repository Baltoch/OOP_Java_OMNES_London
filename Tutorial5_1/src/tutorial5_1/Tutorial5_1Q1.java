 * a. Create an abstract class named Book. Include a String field for the book’s title and a double field for the 
 * book’s price. Within the class, include a constructor that requires the book title, and add two get methods—one 
 * that returns the title and one that returns the price. Include an abstract method named setPrice(). Create two
 * child classes of Book: Fiction and NonFiction. Each must include a setPrice() method that sets the price for all
 * Fiction Books to $24.99 and for all NonFiction Books to $37.99. Write a constructor for each subclass, and include
 * a call to setPrice() within each. Write an application demonstrating that you can create both a Fiction and a
 * NonFiction Book and display their fields. Save the files as Book.java, Fiction.java, NonFiction.java, and UseBook.java.
 * 
 * b. Write an application named BookArray in which you create an array that holds 10 Books, some Fiction and some
 * NonFiction. Using a for loop, display details about all 10 books. Save the file as BookArray.java.
