 * Write a class named RetailItem that holds data about an item in a retail store. The class  should 
 * have the following fields: 
 * 
 *      description: The description field references a String object that holds a brief description 
 *      of the item.  
 * 
 *      unitsOnHand: The unitsOnHand field is an int variable that holds the number of units 
 *      currently in inventory.  
 * 
 *      price: The price field is a double that holds the item’s retail price.
 * 
 * Write a constructor that accepts arguments for each field and accessor methods that return 
 * the values in these fields. Once you have written the class, write a separate program that 
 * creates three RetailItem objects and stores the following data in them:  
 * 
 *                       Description       Units on Hand      Price
 *          Item #1      Jacket                  12           59.95
 *          Item #2      Designer Jeans          40           34.95
 *          Item #3      Shirt                   20           24.95
 * 
 * 
 * Write a CashRegister class that can be used with the RetailItem class. The CashRegister class 
 * should simulate the sale of a retail item. It should have a constructor that accepts a RetailItem
 * object as an argument. The constructor should also accept an integer that represents the quantity
 * of items being purchased. In addition, the class should have the following methods: 
 * 
 *      getSubtotal method should return the subtotal of the sale, which is the quantity multiplied
 *      by the price. This method must get the price from the RetailItem object that was passed as
 *      an argument to the constructor.  
 * 
 *      getTax method should return the amount of sales tax on the purchase. The sales tax rate is
 *      6 percent of a retail sale.  
 * 
 *      getTotal method should return the total of the sale, which is the subtotal plus the 
 *      sales tax. Demonstrate the class in a program that asks the user for the quantity of 
 *      items being purchased, and then displays the sale’s subtotal, amount of sales tax, and total.
